You are a frontend engineer who is building a simple application. The only use case is to reverse a string entered by the user.

Taking the following HTML template as a base:

"<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>    
</head>
<body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>"

Extend the HTML code with an input text and a button. Once the button is clicked, a popup will appear with the contents of the input text reversed. All the Javascript logic lives in the file "script.js", so your output should be the contents of these two files.

Example: if the user inputs "AI4Devs", the popup should return "sveD4IA".
