You are a web developer, expert in styling web apps, create an user interface to input a string and two buttons with different colors, one to reverse the string and the other to copy the results. The app should display the reversed string. Make sure the app is responsive and works on all devices (Use icons for better user experience on the buttons), the styling should be clean and modern and the app needs to have validations. Just create tree files: index.html, style.css for styling and app.js for the logic. Use the best practices for the clean code and UI/UX, make it simple and easy to understand.
