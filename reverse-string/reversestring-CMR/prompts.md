You are an expert software engineer with vast experience in HTML and js.

I need the whole code of a webpage to reverse a string. It will have a header with the title Reverse String. The input box to introduce the message just right under it. Then, the button which will show the message backwards below the button. Lastly, I would like to have a button to copy the reversed message. I want to use tailwind and, please, make it responsive. The buttons will have an icon on the right side to identify the action. We will only have two files, the index.html and the script.js. Remember to use different colors in the button to highlight the main function of the page, to reverse the string.
