Prompt: Create a web page with JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string.

Example: if I input AI4Devs, it should return sveD4IA.

Do it using the seed files index.html and script.js provided in the template folder.


Explanation:

	1.	HTML Structure (index.html):
	•	A simple input field where the user enters the string.
	•	A button labeled “Reverse String” to trigger the reversal.
	•	A paragraph where the reversed string will be displayed.
	2.	JavaScript Logic (script.js):
	•	The reverseString function takes a string, splits it into an array of characters, reverses the array, and joins it back into a string.
	•	We get the input field and the output span by their IDs using getElementById.
	•	An event listener is added to the button so that when it’s clicked, the string entered by the user is reversed and displayed.

This setup will work as expected when you load the index.html file in a browser. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
